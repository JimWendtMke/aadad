<h4>Welcome to the Global UX Documentation and Demo Library</h4>
<p style="width:60%">My last company initiated a project to create and deliver global Angular reusable UX components(gux team)
  based on PrimeFaces. The components created by this team would be consumed by all Angular projects within the
  company(consuming team) via a private npm repository. I was assigned to the gux team and immediately identified core
  deficiences in the architecture.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>There was no capability of testing these components locally. A gux team developer was required to complete the following steps.
  <div style="margin: 10px 20px 10px 15px">
    <img src="./assets/images/flow.jpg" alt="Starting changes workflow">
  </div>
  </li>
  <li>The documentation was inconsistent and out of date on the consuming team's pages</li>
  <div style="margin: 10px 20px 10px 15px">Coming soon</div>
  <li>The documentation must be available to introduce into the consuming team's current documentation page or as a standalone application</li>
  <div style="margin: 10px 20px 10px 15px">Coming soon</div>
</ol>
<h5>NOTE: This is a work in progress to get as much shown as possible. The final version will be cleaned up!</h5>
